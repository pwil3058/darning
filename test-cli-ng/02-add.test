Test the 'darn add' command.

Create some test files.
$ darn_test_tree create

Test adding a file when not in a playground.
$ darn add file1 file2 nonexistent
? 1
! Valid database NOT found.

Initialise a playground and try again without creating a patch
$ darn init --ng
$ darn add file1 file2 nonexistent
? 2
! No patches applied.
$ darn files
? 2
! No patches applied.

Create a patch and add files including a nonexistent one
$ darn new first --descr "First patch created."
$ darn add file1 file2 nonexistent
> file1: file added to patch "first".
> file2: file added to patch "first".
> nonexistent: file added to patch "first".
$ darn files
>  :+: file1
>  :+: file2
> +:+: nonexistent
$ ls .darning.dbd/blobs
> 9d
> cd

Create a second patch and add the same files
$ darn new second --descr "Second patch created."
$ darn add file1 file2 nonexistent
> file1: file added to patch "second".
> file2: file added to patch "second".
> nonexistent: file added to patch "second".
$ darn files
>  :+: file1
>  :+: file2
> +:+: nonexistent
$ darn series
> +: first
> +: second
$ ls .darning.dbd/blobs
> 9d
> cd

Modify some of the files then create a third patch and add the same files
$ darn_test_tree modify file2
$ darn series
> +: first
> ?: second
$ darn files
>  :+: file1
>  :?: file2
> +:+: nonexistent
$ darn new third --descr "Third patch created."
? 1
! Previous top patch ("second") needs refreshing.
$ darn series
> +: first
> ?: second
> +: third
$ darn add file1 file2 nonexistent
? 142
! file2: file has unrefreshed changes in (applied) patch "second".
! Aborted.
$ darn series
> +: first
> ?: second
> +: third
$ darn files
$ ls .darning.dbd/blobs
> 9d
> cd

Do it again and absorb the unrefreshed changes into the third patch.
$ darn add --absorb file1 file2 nonexistent
> file1: file added to patch "third".
> file2: file added to patch "third".
! file2: Unrefeshed changes in patch "second" incorporated in patch "third".
> nonexistent: file added to patch "third".
$ darn series
> +: first
> +: second
> ?: third
$ darn files
>  :+: file1
>  :?: file2
> +:+: nonexistent
$ ls .darning.dbd/blobs
> 9d
> cd

Confirm that the change has been absorbed into "third" patch.

Do it again into a fourth patch using --force.
$ darn new fourth --descr "Fourth patch created."

$ darn_test_tree modify file1
$ darn add --force file1 file2 nonexistent
