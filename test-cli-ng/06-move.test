Test the 'darn move' command.

Create some test files.
$ darn_test_tree create

Make a playground and patch
$ darn init --ng
$ darn new first
$ darn add file4
> file4: file added to patch "first".
$ darn_test_tree modify file4

Try to move a single nonexistent file
$ darn move nonexistent nonexistent.moved
? 2
! nonexistent: file does not exist.
$ darn move nonexistent file1
? 2
! nonexistent: file does not exist.
$ darn move nonexistent file4
? 2
! nonexistent: file does not exist.

Try to move a two nonexistent file
$ darn move nonexistent1 nonexistent2 dir1
? 2

$ darn move nonexistent1 nonexistent2 file1 dir1
? 2
! nonexistent1: file does not exist.
! nonexistent2: file does not exist.

! file1: target must be a directory for multiple file move operation.

Try move two files to an existing directory without --overwrite
$ darn move file1 file2 dir1
? 34
! dir1/file1: file already exists.
! dir1/file2: file already exists.

Try move two files to a nonexistent directory without --mkdir
$ darn move file1 file2 newdir
? 2
! newdir: does not exist. Use --mkdir to create it.

Try move two files to a nonexistent directory with --mkdir
$ darn move --mkdir file1 file2 newdir
> file1: file renamed to "newdir/file1" in patch "first".
